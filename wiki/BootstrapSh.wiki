#summary bootstrap.sh - Creating a new Typo3 installation from scratch.

= Introduction =

The main purpose of `bootstrap.sh` is to ease deployment of a new Typo3 installation. At the time of writing, the easing is limited mostly to downloading the Typo3 package for you.

= Arguments =
{{{
$ ./bootstrap.sh --help
  Usage: ./bootstrap.sh [OPTIONS --version=<VERSION>]|<VERSION>

  Core:
  --help              Display this help and exit.
  --update            Tries to update the script to the latest version.
  --base=PATH         The name of the base path where Typo3 should be
                      installed. If no base is supplied, "typo3" is used.

  Options:
  --version=VERSION   The version to install.

  Database:
  --hostname=HOST     The name of the host where the Typo3 database is running.
  --username=USER     The username to use when connecting to the Typo3
                      database.
  --password=PASSWORD The password to use when connecting to the Typo3
                      database.
  --database=DB       The name of the database in which Typo3 is stored.

  Note: When using an external configuration file, it is sufficient to supply
        just the target version as a parameter.
        When supplying other any command line argument, supply the target
        version through the --version command line parameter.
}}}

Please note, all scripts in the typo3scripts suite always try to _source_ these parameters from an external configuration file named like the script itself with a `.conf` suffix rather than the `.sh` suffix.
So for `bootstrap.sh` the proper configuration file would be `bootstrap.conf`.
The correct contents for that configuration file can always be taken from the scripts themselves. It is contained between the `# Script Configuration start` and `# Script Configuration end` markers.

The script will always assume the default configuration at first (as defined in the script itself). It then overrides the default configuration with the one defined in aforementioned configuration file. It will then override those values with whatever had been passed on the command line.

*Hint*: It may be desirable to construct a configuration file for `bootstrap.sh` right away (even though you might only be using the script once) as other scripts in this suite can use the same configuration file.

Creating a new installation is straight-forward. You simply retrieve the script, make it executable and pass the Typo3 version you want to use as an argument.

By default, the installation will be created in a subfolder called `typo3`. This is due to the way the other scripts interact with a Typo3 installation. You can change the name of that subfolder with the `--base` command line parameter.

Additionally, `bootstrap.sh` accepts parameters related to the database Typo3 should use. `bootstrap.sh` accepts these parameters for interoperability reasons with other scripts in this suite (which require a database connection). This allows you to construct a single configuration which all scripts can make use of.
These parameters will be written to the Typo3 `localconf.php` file.

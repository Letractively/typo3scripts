#summary extUpdate.sh - Determine update status of installed TYPO3 extensions.

= Introduction =

The main purpose of `extUpdate.sh` is to retrieve the version of the latest update for a given TYPO3 extension (or all TYPO3 extensions) and compare it to the version of the locally installed copy.  
Optionally, if ExtChangelogSh is available as well, the upload comments for the pending updates can be displayed.

= Arguments =
{{{

  --base=PATH         The name of the base path where Typo3 is
                      installed. If no base is supplied, "typo3" is used.
  --export-config     Prints the default configuration of this script.
  --extract-config    Extracts configuration parameters from TYPO3.

== Overview ==

For general information regarding the configuration of scripts in the typo3scripts suite, please see the article about Configuration.

== `--help` ==
Prints the output seen above, giving an overview of available command line parameters.

== `--update` ==
Invokes the self-updating mechanism in this script. This will download the latest release version (from SVN trunk) from `code.google.com` and replace your current script.

Please note, every time the script runs it will perform a quick check if a new version is available. If a new version is found online, the following message will be printed to the standard output:
{{{
NOTE: New version available!
}}}

== `--base` / `BASE` ==
By default, TYPO3 installations will be created in a subfolder relative to the current working directory, named `typo3`. Use `--base` if the installation should be placed in a differently named subfolder.
{{{
$ ./extUpdate.sh --base=myt3site
}}}

== `--export-config` ==
Print the default configuration of the script to the standard output.

This allows for easy generation of a default config file, like so:
{{{
$ ./extUpdate.sh --export-config > typo3scripts.conf
}}}

== `--extract-config` ==
Tries to read the database-related parameters out of the TYPO3 configuration file.

This allows for easy generation of a base config file for other typo3scripts after you have completed your TYPO3 installation.
{{{
$ ./extUpdate.sh --extract-config > typo3scripts.conf
}}}

In case you're using a non-default TYPO3 installation directory, make sure to supply the `--base` parameter *before* the `--extract-config` parameter.
{{{
$ ./extUpdate.sh --base=myt3site --extract-config > typo3scripts.conf
}}}

== `--hostname` / `HOST` ==
The name of the host where the database for TYPO3 is running.

== `--username` / `USER` ==
The username for the connection to the database for the TYPO3 installation.

== `--password` / `PASS` ==
The password for the connection to the database for the TYPO3 installation. If not defined, `bootstrap.sh` will try to initialize the password to a random 16 character string.

== `--database` / `DB` ==
The name of the database for the TYPO3 installation. This parameter is currently unused.
